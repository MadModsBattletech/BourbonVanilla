# Bourbon - Vanilla Enhanced

[Battletech ModCollection][ModTek] A custom flavor of HBS Battletech. Various little changes and additions to make the game more diverse, harder and more fun. At least for me.  
Unlike some other bigger modpacks, this little mod collection is also tailored for the base campaign. There are many small fixes and additions that only concern the campaign. Career mode is fully supported too. 
The scope of Bourbon is to carefully expand on the Core gameplay, make it more challenging and fix some issues i had with the game but not to overhaul or overwhelm it with new content. 
All included mods are maintained by myself (including forks of some popular mods), the only external dependency is ModTek to actually patch the game and enable the mods.  
I always tried to utilize the UI to describe/show important changes within tooltips or combat floaties or similar so players don't need to read instructions outside the game to understand what's happening.
Probably the best experience is to just drop this collection in and play the game!



## What And Why
I mostly like the base game as it is but while playing it for many many hours some things emerged which in my opinion were illogical, boring or unbalanced. I'll list some of these things for you to better decide if this modpack is for you...  

* The OpFor doesn't utilize higher quality gear. Why would only the players company have access to high quality gear? And where does that gear come from during salvage?
	* The OpFor will field Mechs with high quality gear now, depending on progress in Campaign or Career
* Vigilance and Precision Strike are overpowered
	* Resolve generation is toned down, the abilites will cost more resolve to be used
	* Headshots are limited to a subset of the available weapons
* Jumping combined with backstabbing is lacking risk.
	* Introduced a ToHit-Penalty and stability damage for jumping. At least it comes with a downside now.
* Elite pilots (10/10/10/10) make the gameplay shallow
	* It's nearly impossible to reach level 10 in all skills, your decisions for where to put points are more important now.
	* Individual performance of pilots is taken into consideration when XP are gained
* Company morale changes are mostly meaningless as are the corresponding Argo Upgrades. You'll quickly end up at 45-50 anyhow.
	* There's a reset to (25 + Upgrades) at each quarter now (35max)
	* Events will increase or decrease your company morale for a limited time (but with much greater impact)
* You can overrun low skull missions with Assaults and no risk if you want to
	* Exceeding a certain tonnage limit is really expensive now and fosters a finances vs. risk decision
* Ejections and a related "stress-meta" are non-existant
	* Stress levels and ejection chances for enemies as allies are in place now
* Juggernaut (and Coolant Vent) suck
	* Coolant Vent is gone and Juggernauts will pack their punch
* Stability meta is built around missiles while Autocannons fall off in this regard, especially with the higher quality gear in late game
	* This is moderately adjusted with missiles beeing a bit weaker and AC's better at dealing stability damage
* Higher quality gear, especially some weapons are overpowered
	* This is carefully reduced to make them still worthwhile but less godmode
	
In addition to the above there are many small things in place which will most likely enhance the experience

* You can choose a png for your pilots avatar (Thx to morphyum)
* Dekker, Behemoth, Medusa and Glitch look really good now (Thx to kohour)
* MechParts cost is adjusted depending on how many of them you'd need to assemble a Mech
* The Argo holds a nice surprise
* Shops have some regular gear
* Some more opportunities to get your hands on SLDF Mechs
* The intros are skipped (Thx to mpstark)
* DFA's remove entrenched
* And many more small fixes and additions

If you only like a part of this stuff feel free to browse my github and pick only some mods you like. See list at the end of this file.



## Installation
This modpack requires ModTek which *is included* in the download for convenience. This leaves the following few things to be done to install:

* Extract into /BATTLETECH/Mods/ (Create directory if it doesn't exist)
	* If you already patched your game and/or have a newer version of ModTek available you can choose to *not* overwrite ModTek
* Execute "/BATTLETECH/Mods/ModTek/ModTekInjector.exe" (to patch game assembly and enable mods)
	* If you haven't already...
* Run game



## Requirements
Tested against BTG 1.8.1 with all DLCs. Most likely it is possible to run this modpack without some of the DLCs present but i did not (and will not) verify this.  
I will appreciate feedback regarding this topic though.

	

## Adjustments
Many mods have settings to adjust them to your liking. Feel free to do that but be aware that this can screw up balance.  
Some mods are currently disabled. There are reasons for that.



## Disclaimer
Use at your own risk. I am willing to help if problems arise but please keep in mind that i am one person alone and doing this in my free time.  
It's perfectly possible to drop this modpack onto a running game according to my tests.  
Saves made while this modpack was active will most likely break without it present.
You can have more mods on top of this as to your liking, but please keep in mind that there could arise conflicts and balance problems.
